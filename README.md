This is a photography portfolio website I made for my girlfriend. It consists of 3 main componenets:

1. Front End Code
2. API for Contact Form
3. Database to store data submitted through contact form


I used an AWS EC2 instance to have the database up and running at all times, and used an S3 bucket to store my front end code. 
Right now I have the API stored in an S3 bucketas well, but I hope to change that to an API Gateway that is linked to my front 
end S3 bucket using lambda.
